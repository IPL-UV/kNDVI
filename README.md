# On Kernel Vegetation Indices

Empirical vegetation indices derived from spectral reflectance data are widely used in remote sensing of the biosphere, as they represent robust proxies for canopy structure, leaf pigment content and, subsequently, plant photosynthetic potential. Here we generalize the broad family of commonly used vegetation indices by exploiting all  higher-order relations between the spectral channels involved. This results in a higher sensitivity to vegetation biophysical and physiological parameters. The presented nonlinear generalization of the celebrated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) consistently improves accuracy in monitoring key parameters, such as leaf area index, gross primary productivity, and sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence. Check the paper and (especially) the supplementary material for more details, parameter prescriptions, other examples of application and code snippets and demos.

# On the kNDVI

Here you find some basic implementations in several computer languages: Python, JavaScript for GEE, R, Julia, MATLAB, and IDL. Also, we give Google Earth Engine (GEE) examples in https://code.earthengine.google.com/?accept_repo=users/belmanip/kNDVI
